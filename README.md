## What Vue.js is
simply put it is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.  Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Deliverables
 A crud Aplication using DotNet Core and Vue. The Apllication should be Should contain a list of foods that gives a short description of the food, the calory count and how tasty the food is. 


Vue:
 * Use the vue CLI
 * The page will update which foods details to display using Vue to dynamically update the page using V-on mouseover.
 * You will use Vif and Velse to determine weather to display the calory count or a form for the user to add the calory count.
 * You will implement a nested reviews component for users to see and add or edit reviews for each food.
 * Each compont should be a single page compontent


NetCore:
