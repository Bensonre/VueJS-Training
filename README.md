# VueJS-Training
A Training program for Vue.JS for OSU Cass Employees using Visual studio 2017. Inorder to complete this Training you must be filmilar with working in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

This Training is based off of Create a Vue.js application using Node.js Tools for Visual Studio tutrial found here
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/create-application-with-vuejs?view=vs-2017

## Requirements:
- You must have Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 Preview 3 or later installed and the Node.js development workload.
- To create the ASP.NET Core project, you must have the ASP.NET and web development and .NET Core cross-platform development workloads installed.
- You must have the Node.js runtime installed.

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the Visual Studio downloads page to install it for free.

If you need to install the workload but already have Visual Studio, click the Open Visual Studio Installer link in the left pane of the New Project dialog box (select File > New > Project). The Visual Studio Installer launches. Choose the Node.js development workload, then choose Modify.

If you don't have it installed, install the LTS version from the Node.js website. In general, Visual Studio automatically detects the installed Node.js runtime. If it does not detect an installed runtime, you can configure your project to reference the installed runtime in the properties page. (After you create a project, right-click the project node and choose Properties).

## What Vue.js is
simply put it is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.  Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
## Useful Videos
 I recommend follow the quick video series Vue.js put introducing it found here.
